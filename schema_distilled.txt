Below is a distilled, high‐level outline of the overall schema structure as extracted from the dump. (Note that many details such as indexes, privileges, and default privileges have been omitted for clarity.)

Schema: _realtime
	•	Tables:
	•	extensions: Contains metadata/settings for realtime extensions.
	•	schema_migrations: Stores migration versions for the realtime layer.

	•	users: The core table for user login data.
	•	Functions:
	•	email(), jwt(), role(), uid(): (Legacy and current functions for extracting JWT claims.)
	•	Row-Level Security & Policies:
	•	Various RLS policies and triggers (e.g. on_auth_user_created) ensure that users can only view and modify their own records.

Schema: extensions
	•	Functions:
	•	A suite of cryptographic and utility functions such as:
	•	algorithm_sign, armor, dearmor
	•	crypt, decrypt, decrypt_iv
	•	digest, encrypt, encrypt_iv
	•	gen_random_bytes, gen_random_uuid, gen_salt
	•	hmac, uuid_generate_* functions, verify, etc.
	•	Functions to grant access to other extensions/features (e.g. grant_pg_cron_access, grant_pg_graphql_access, grant_pg_net_access).
	•	Event Triggers:
	•	Triggers such as issue_pg_cron_access and issue_pg_graphql_access run after DDL changes.
	•	Tables:
	•	Extension objects like pg_stat_statements (for tracking SQL performance).

Schema: graphql / graphql_public
	•	graphql_public:
	•	Functions:
	•	A public wrapper function (graphql()) that exposes GraphQL queries.
	•	(The “graphql” schema itself is likely used for internal GraphQL support.)

Schema: net
	•	Functions:
	•	http_get and http_post: Asynchronous HTTP functions for external calls.

Schema: pgbouncer
	•	Functions:
	•	get_auth: A function used by PgBouncer for authentication.

Schema: pgsodium
	•	Functions:
	•	crypto_aead_det_decrypt, crypto_aead_det_encrypt, crypto_aead_det_keygen: For modern cryptography operations.
	•	Tables:
	•	(Supporting tables such as decrypted_key, masking_rule, and mask_columns may be present for key management and masking.)

Schema: realtime
	•	Tables:
	•	messages: Stores realtime messages for broadcast (partitioned by insertion timestamp).
	•	schema_migrations: Realtime-specific migration tracking.
	•	subscription: Manages realtime subscription configurations including filters and claims.
	•	Functions:
	•	apply_rls: Applies row-level security checks on change data.
	•	broadcast_changes: Packages and sends change notifications.
	•	build_prepared_statement_sql: Constructs SQL for testing visibility of changes.
	•	"cast": Casts values safely for change processing.
	•	check_equality_op: Evaluates user-defined filter operators.
	•	is_visible_through_filters: Determines whether a record is visible given subscription filters.
	•	list_changes: Retrieves changes (using logical decoding).
	•	quote_wal2json: Prepares entity names for WAL-to-JSON conversion.
	•	send: Enqueues a message for broadcast.
	•	subscription_check_filters: Validates filters when a subscription is created or updated.
	•	to_regrole: Converts role names to PostgreSQL role types.
	•	topic: Retrieves the current realtime topic.
	•	Event Triggers:
	•	pgrst_ddl_watch and pgrst_drop_watch: Monitor DDL changes to reload schema as needed.
	•	Additional event triggers (e.g. issue_graphql_placeholder) support dynamic behavior after certain DDL events.

Schema: storage
	•	Tables:
	•	buckets: Definitions for storage buckets.
	•	migrations: Tracks schema migrations for storage.
	•	objects: Stores file objects and metadata (with generated path tokens).
	•	s3_multipart_uploads: Tracks multipart upload sessions.
	•	s3_multipart_uploads_parts: Stores parts for multipart uploads.
	•	Functions:
	•	can_insert_object: Checks whether an object can be inserted into storage.
	•	extension, filename, foldername: Utility functions for parsing object names.
	•	get_size_by_bucket: Aggregates storage size per bucket.
	•	list_multipart_uploads_with_delimiter and list_objects_with_delimiter: Functions to support S3-like listing operations.
	•	operation: Retrieves the current storage operation context.
	•	search: Supports searching and paginating objects.
	•	update_updated_at_column: A trigger function to update the updated_at timestamp.
	•	Triggers:
	•	Trigger on objects to update timestamps on change.

Schema: supabase_functions
	•	Tables:
	•	hooks: Audit trail of function hook invocations.
	•	migrations: Tracks schema changes for Supabase functions.
	•	Functions:
	•	http_request: A trigger function to perform HTTP calls (using net.http_get/ http_post) and log the request.

Schema: supabase_migrations
	•	Tables:
	•	schema_migrations: Used for managing Supabase-specific migrations.

Schema: vault
	•	Views:
	•	decrypted_secrets: A view that decrypts stored secrets using functions from pgsodium.
	•	Triggers:
	•	A trigger (e.g. secrets_encrypt_secret_secret) automatically encrypts secrets before storage.

Additional Notes:
	•	Row-Level Security: Most tables (especially in auth, realtime, and storage) have RLS enabled along with defined policies to control which roles (such as anon, authenticated, service_role, and dashboard_user) can perform specific operations.
	•	Default Privileges: The dump sets up default privileges for roles across schemas so that functions, tables, and sequences have appropriate access.

This outline represents a “consolidated schema structure” showing the main schemas and the types of objects they contain, which should provide a distilled context of the overall database design.
